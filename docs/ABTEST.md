1. A/B Test Name: Quick-Cart Background Color Change (Green vs. Black)
User Story #6:
This A/B test falls under UI/UX enhancements for the Quick-Cart app. It aims to determine if changing the background color from green to black improves user engagement and retention.
Metrics:
The HEART metrics being measured include:
Engagement: Time spent on the app
Retention: Number of returning users
Task Success: User interaction with key app features


Hypothesis:
Problem: Users may find the green background too bright, causing eye strain or making text less readable.
Hypothesis: Changing the background to black will improve readability, reduce eye strain, and potentially increase user engagement and retention.
Experiment:
Setup: A remote config setup in Firebase is used to dynamically switch the background color from green (Control) to black (Variant).
Audience: A/B test will be rolled out to 50% of users to compare behavior between both color themes.
Tracking: Firebase Analytics will be used to measure time spent on the app, feature interaction rates, and return sessions.
Variations:
Control Group (A): Default green background
Variant Group (B): Black background
Mockups of both designs will be included for comparison. The final variation will be selected based on engagement and user feedback data.

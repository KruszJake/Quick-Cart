Observation 1:
  -Most users struggle to find the best prices while grocery shopping.
  -69% of users who took the survey said that finding the best prices was their biggest challenge, and 53.8% said they would want notifications for sales on frequently purchased items.
  -We can build a feature to view prices of items at different stores and provide notifications when items go on sale.

-Most respondents 57.7% rely on memory-based shopping rather than written lists or grocery apps.
-According to the pie chart, 57.7% of responses use memory-based shopping, only 30.8% use notes on their phones, 7.7% use other grocery apps, and a small fraction use handwritten lists.
-Make a grocery shopping assistant feature that helps users track their purchases and suggest lists based on previous shopping habits.

Observation 3: 
-Users face key challenges like forgetting items, overspending , and finding the best prices. Additionally, respondents rely on memory-based shopping, while some use digital notes, showing a gap in structured grocery planning.Since most users face these challenges; we can implement features that:
-Suggests frequently bought items
-Allow users to set a spending limit, and the app alerts them if they are overspending
-Users get alerts when staple items are running low.

Observation 4: 
-A majority of respondents 53.8% prefer receiving notifications about sales on frequently bought items.
-The bar chart indicates that 53.8% of users find sale alerts useful, while 46.2% prefer budget warnings, 38.5% want reminders for expiring pantry items, and 30.8% do not want notifications at all.
=Implement a notification feature that prioritizes sale alerts on frequently bought items, with optional toggles for other types of notifications to accommodate different preferences.

Observation 1:
  -Most users struggle to find the best prices while grocery shopping.
  -69% of users who took the survey said that finding the best prices was their biggest challenge, and 53.8% said they would want notifications for sales on frequently purchased items.
  -We can build a feature to view prices of items at different stores and provide notifications when items go on sale.




Observation 3: 
 Users face key challenges like forgetting items, overspending , and finding the best prices. Additionally, respondents rely on memory-based shopping, while some use digital notes, showing a gap in structured grocery planning.


Since most users face these challenges; we can implement features that:
1. Suggests frequently bought items
2. Allow users to set a spending limit, and the app alerts them if they are overspending
3. Users get alerts when staple items are running low.
